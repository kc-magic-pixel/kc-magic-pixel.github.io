The KCFGC Resources directory contains events, organizations, and community-made content created for and organized by fighting game players in the greater Kansas City area. This entire website (including its content!) is open source and welcoming contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/kcfgc/kcfgc.github.io). It is operated by [Magic Pixel]({{< ref "/organizations/magic-pixel" >}}) in the interest of promoting all events in the Kansas City FGC scene.
