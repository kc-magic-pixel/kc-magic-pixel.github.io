## It's the new Magic Pixel Weekly! 

Event will be hosted at a new location, right next to Game Cafe. Door says "Kreative Caviar".   

It's the last Tuesday of the month, which means it's all community-organized games! There will be free brackets and casuals only.

Each week a minimum of 4 setups worth of space will be reserved for casual play and side brackets. This space can be reserved by anyone wanting to organize another game, please join us on  [discord](https://discord.gg/jkmn6CVrrQ) if you'd like to do so! Community-organized events will be posted here as they're confirmed.

Keep an eye on our [start.gg hub](https://www.start.gg/hub/magic-pixel) for future events, and [kcfgc.com](https://kcfgc.com) for more of what's going on in the KC scene!
