## Welcome to the Magic Pixel Weekly! 

Brackets will be run for a rotating selection of games each week. On-stream games will have a $5 entry fee and a payout for top 3. Off-stream games will be free entry. Casuals are welcome all night, as long as setups are available, so please bring a setup if you are able!

Each week a minimum of 4 setups worth of space will be reserved for casual play and side brackets. This space can be reserved by anyone wanting to organize any game they want to see played, please join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/jkmn6CVrrQ) if you'd like to do so! Community-organized events will be posted here as they're confirmed.

Keep an eye on our [start.gg hub](https://www.start.gg/hub/magic-pixel) for future events, and [kcfgc.com](https://kcfgc.com) for more of what's going on in the KC scene!

### Entry

$5 venue fee, collected by the TO.  
$5/game (excluding off-stream brackets), collected by the TO. CASH ONLY.  
Drinks and snacks available for purchase.
