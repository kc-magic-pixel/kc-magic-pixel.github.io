Event will be hosted at a new location, right next to Game Cafe. Door says "Kreative Caviar".
Brackets will be run for posted main games, with a payout for top 3. Free side brackets will be run some weeks, depending on interest/availability (if you're interested in running a side bracket, come talk to a TO!).
Please bring a setup if you're able! Casual matches are welcome all night, but bracket matches will be prioritized.
